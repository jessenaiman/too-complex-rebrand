## Description
The rebranding system currently has 296 linting and build errors that need to be addressed. This is blocking progress on the project.

## Current Issues
1. JSX parsing errors in testimonial-card.tsx
2. Unescaped entities in multiple files
3. Unused variables and imports throughout the codebase
4. Missing dependencies in useEffect hooks
5. Various other linting warnings and errors

## Expected Behavior
The rebranding system should build successfully with minimal warnings.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Run `next build` in the project directory
2. Observe the 296 errors in the output

## Additional Context
Creating this issue as a checkpoint to save our progress. We need to address these issues systematically in a new branch.

## Files Affected

- components/rebrand/rebrand-page.tsx
- components/rebrand/rebrand.tsx
- components/rebrand/ai-rebrandable-content.tsx
- components/rebrand/individual-rebrandable.tsx
- components/nav.tsx
- And many others

## Priority
