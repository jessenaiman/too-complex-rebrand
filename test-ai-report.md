# Playwright Test Issues Report

## Summary
All 30 tests are currently failing because they cannot navigate to the application. The primary issue is that the Playwright configuration was missing the `baseURL` setting.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Playwright Configuration Issue
**Problem**: Missing `baseURL` in `playwright.config.ts`
**Solution**: Added `baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000'` to the configuration
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 2. Development Server
**Problem**: Tests need the development server to be running on port 3000
**Solution**: Confirmed that `pnpm run dev` is running in the background
**Status**: ✅ Running

## Additional Issues That May Arise After Fixing the Base URL

Once the base URL issue is resolved, we may encounter these additional issues that will need to be addressed:

### 3. Locator Issues
Several tests are looking for elements with specific selectors that may not match the current implementation:
- Looking for `nav img[alt="Brand Logo"]` - may need to update based on actual logo alt text
- Looking for specific text content like "Generating New Brand" - may need to match actual loading text
- Looking for specific class names or text that may have changed

### 4. Test Logic Issues
- Some tests assume specific business names/descriptions that may not be in the current dataset
- Some tests check for specific UI elements that may have been updated in the rebrand implementation

### 5. Sequential API Call Verification
- The test for sequential API calls may need adjustment to properly intercept and verify the order of calls

### 6. Color/Animation Verification
- Tests checking for random colors/animations may need to be more flexible in their assertions

## Next Steps
1. Run the tests again with the fixed configuration
2. Identify any remaining failing tests
3. Update test selectors and logic as needed
4. Verify all functional requirements are met
