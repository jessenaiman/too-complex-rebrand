# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Implement a dynamic, AI-powered rebranding feature for a Next.js portfolio/blog template that allows users to instantly redesign the entire page or individual components with a single click by dynamically swapping themes, textual content, and AI-generated visual assets using the Pollinations.AI API.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: Next.js v15.5.3, React v19.1.0, Tailwind CSS v4.1.13, Shadcn UI, Framer Motion, MagicUI
- **AI Service**: Pollinations.AI API for image and text generation
- **Architecture**: All rebrand logic isolated to the `app/` directory with kebab-case naming convention
- **Component Structure**: Uses React Context for state management and React hooks for functionality
- **Theme System**: 5 predefined Shadcn themes with random selection and color adjustments
- **Content System**: 5+ business profiles stored in YAML for randomization
- **Asset Storage**: AI-generated images stored in `public/` directory
- **Validation Sequence**: `pnpm lint` → `pnpm run dev` → `curl -Is http://localhost:3000 | head -n 1` → `next build`

## Recent Actions
- Created comprehensive Playwright tests for all 10 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-010)
- Fixed Playwright configuration by adding baseURL for proper test navigation
- Identified test failures due to navigation issues which were resolved by configuration fix
- Analyzed component structure and identified that Radix UI components are correctly used through shadcn/ui wrappers
- Reviewed existing rebrand implementation including global rebrand functionality and component-level rebranding hooks

## Current Plan
1. [IN PROGRESS] Run Playwright tests with fixed configuration to identify remaining issues
2. [TODO] Fix any failing tests by updating selectors and logic to match current implementation
3. [TODO] Verify all functional requirements are properly implemented and tested
4. [TODO] Update architecture-plan.md with testing progress and completion status
5. [TODO] Ensure all validation steps pass without errors
6. [TODO] Address any Radix UI alias configuration issues to prevent AI agent from making incorrect edits
