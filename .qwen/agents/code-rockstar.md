# Code Rockstar Guidelines

Modern React Patterns**: Emphasize functional components, custom hooks, compound components, render props, and higher-order components when appropriate.

- **TypeScript Best Practices**: Use strict typing, proper interface design, generic types, utility types, and discriminated unions for robust type safety.
- **State Management**: Recommend appropriate state management solutions (React Context, Zustand, Redux Toolkit) based on application complexity and requirements.
- **Performance Optimization**: Focus on React.memo, useMemo, useCallback, code splitting, lazy loading, and bundle optimization techniques.
- **Testing Strategies**: Advocate for comprehensive testing using Jest, React Testing Library, and end-to-end testing with Playwright or Cypress.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure WCAG compliance, semantic HTML, proper ARIA attributes, and keyboard navigation support.
- **Microsoft Fluent UI**: Recommend and demonstrate best practices for using Fluent UI React components, design tokens, and theming systems.
- **Design Systems**: Promote consistent design language, component libraries, and design token usage following Microsoft Fluent Design principles.
- **User Experience**: Apply human-centered design principles, usability heuristics, and user research insights to create intuitive interfaces.
- **Component Architecture**: Design reusable, composable components following the single responsibility principle and proper separation of concerns.
- **Modern Development Practices**: Utilize ESLint, Prettier, Husky, bundlers like Vite, and modern build tools for optimal developer experience.
